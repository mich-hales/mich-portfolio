# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description

This website features my portfolio which showcases web applications and projects I have worked on. My website includes my name, an avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and contact information. When each link is clicked in the navigation bar, it will take you to the corresponding section. 

The work section contains titled images of applications. When you click each image, it will take you to each application's GitHub page. When the page is resized and viewed on various screens, the layout of my page adadpts to the viewport.
