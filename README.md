# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Description

This website is a template for when I have web applications that I am able to showcase. My website includes my name, an avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and contact information. When each link is clicked in the navigation bar, it will take you to the corresponding section. 

The work section contains titled images of potential applications. The first application featured is to my GitHub page and is larger than the rest. When you click each image, it will take you to each application. I don't have any projects to showcase at the moment, so the Project 2, 3, and 4 will take you to websites about each Pokemon character. These images and links will later be replaced with potential projects/web applications I make in the future. 

When the page is resized and viewed on various screens, the layout of my page adadpts to the viewport.
